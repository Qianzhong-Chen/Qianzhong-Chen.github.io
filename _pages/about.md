Hello! Thank you for visiting my website. I'm a second year Master's student at Stanford studying Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am a research assistant at [Stanford-MSL](https://msl.stanford.edu/) working with [Dr. Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/). Previous to that, I was a research assistant at [UIUC-ACRL](https://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/) working with [Dr. Naira Hovakimyan](https://mechse.illinois.edu/people/profile/nhovakim) and [Dr. Sheng Cheng](https://sheng-cheng.github.io/). My interests and background are across robot control (both optimization based & learning based), mobile robot decision making & motion planning, mobile manipulation, and embodied AI. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from both Zhejiang University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023. My Curriculum Vitae can be found [here](https://github.com/Qianzhong-Chen/Qianzhong-Chen.github.io/blob/master/files/Qianzhong_Chen_CV.pdf).
